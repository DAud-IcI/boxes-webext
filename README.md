# boxes-webext
A Web Extensions addon for putting your currently unneeded tabs into "boxes" for storage or transfer.

## What
If have a lot of tabs open but you don't actually need most of them for what you are doing right now. This extension lets you put many tabs into one single tab that has lists of annoted links.

## Where
Firefox users can get the extension on AMO here: {TODO: PUBLISH TO AMO}

## Why
You probably have dozens of tabs open, even though you won't open most of them in your current session. And we all know that the bookmarks menu is just a bottomless pit where things go to get lost forever... Your tabs store some of their state in memory even when they are unloaded, but do you need any of that other than the URL? I think no, and that's why **Boxes** exist. So you can pack your things away but still keep them accessible on your tab bar

## When
When it's done. This is my learning project into WebExtensions that I do in my free time so expect slow development. You are welcome to contribute of course.

## How
If you clone the repo, [use the web-ext tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext) to run it in Firefox. Alternatively, go to about:debugging.
